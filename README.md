ðŸŽ¯ Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application Completed

Built a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implemented features to:

Handle user clicks and update the game board.

Track game state and determine winning conditions.

Enable play between two players or against an AI opponent.

This project enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation, game logic, and event-driven programming. It also reinforced my skills in structuring clean, maintainable code for interactive web applications.
